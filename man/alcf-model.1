.SH "NAME"
\fBalcf\-model\fR \- Extract model data at a point or along a track\.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
alcf model <type> point: { <lon> <lat> } time: { <start> <end> } [options] [\-\-] <input> <output>

alcf model <type> track: <track> [options] [\-\-] <input> <output>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Arguments following \fB\-\-\fR are treated as literal strings\. Use this delimiter if the input or output file names might otherwise be interpreted as non\-strings, e\.g\. purely numerical file names\.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtype\fR: Input data type (see Types below)\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBinput\fR: Input directory\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBoutput\fR: Output directory\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBlon\fR: Point longitude (degrees East)\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBlat\fR: Point latitutde (degrees North)\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBstart\fR: Start time (see Time format below)\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBend\fR: End time (see Time format below)\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBtrack: <file>\fR, \fBtrack: { <file>\|\.\|\.\|\. }\fR: One or more track NetCDF files (see Files below)\. If multiple files are supplied and \fBtime_bnds\fR is not present in the files, they are assumed to be multiple segments of a discontinous track unless the last and first time of adjacent tracks are the same\.
.IP "\[ci]" 4
\fBoptions\fR: See Options below\.
.IP "" 0
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBnjobs: <n>\fR
Number of parallel jobs\. Default: number of CPU cores\.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Process the input directory recursively\.
.TP
\fB\-\-track_lon_180\fR
Expect track longitude between \-180 and 180 degrees\. This option is no longer needed as the conversion is automatically\. [deprecated]
.TP
\fBoverride_year: <year>\fR
Override year in the track\. Use if comparing observations with a model statistically and the model output does not have a corresponding year available\. The observation time is converted to the same time relative to the start of the year in the specified year\. Note that if the original year is a leap year and the override year is not, as a consequence of the above 31 December is mapped to 1 January\. The output retains the original year as in the track, even though the model data come from the override year\. Default: \fBnone\fR\.
.TP
\fBtrack_gap: <interval>\fR
If the interval is not 0, a track file is supplied, the \fBtime_bnds\fR variable is not defined in the file and any two adjacent points are separated by more than the specified time interval (seconds), then a gap is assumed to be present between the two data points, instead of interpolating location between the two points\. Default: \fB21600\fR (6 hours)\.
.SH "TYPES"

.SH "TIME FORMAT"
\fBYYYY\-MM\-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]\fR, where \fBYYYY\fR is year, \fBMM\fR is month, \fBDD\fR is day, \fBHH\fR is hour, \fBMM\fR is minute, \fBSS\fR is second\. Example: \fB2000\-01\-01T00:00:00\fR\.
.SH "FILES"
The track file is a NetCDF file containing 1D variables \fBlon\fR, \fBlat\fR, \fBtime\fR, and optionally \fBtime_bnds\fR\. \fBtime\fR and \fBtime_bnds\fR are time in format conforming with the CF Conventions (has a valid \fBunits\fR attribute and optional \fBcalendar\fR attribute), \fBlon\fR is longitude between 0 and 360 degrees and \fBlat\fR is latitude between \-90 and 90 degrees\. If \fBtime_bnds\fR is provided, discontinous track segments can be specified if adjacent time bounds are not coincident\. The variables \fBlon\fR, \fBlat\fR and \fBtime\fR have a single dimension \fBtime\fR\. The variable \fBtime_bnds\fR has dimensions (\fBtime\fR, \fBbnds\fR)\.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Extract MERRA\-2 model data in \fBM2I3NVASM\.5\.12\.4\fR at 45 S, 170 E between 1 and 2 January 2020 and store the output in the directory \fBalcf_merra2_model\fR\.
